    Android Camera app with pre-recording functionality. The camera starts “pre-cording” video and audio into a memory buffer as soon as the app is launched. When the user taps the shutter button, the pre-recorded segment of video/audio is prepended into the current recording segment. The user is able to point and record indefinitely without wasting storage space until they decide to save the video. The main focus of this app is to give users a new convenience in video recording.
    
    **Example use cases**
    - Funny pet moments that might be missed with a normal video camera app
    - Sport play highlights
    - A baby's first moments
    - A Friend doing a trick that requires multiple attempts
    
    **Knowledge gained**
    - Advanced Android app development
    - Basic OpenGL ES
    - Video and audio manipulation

    Android app for Facebook-like "chat head" with camera preview. Built with open sourced softwares. 
    
    While very convenient for users, current average phones aren’t fast enough to handle video recording with concurrent background task switching/loading. Final video loses frame rate with normal user activity while recording. The performance hit is less noticeable on high-end phones. Potentially a feature to add to the Previe project in the future.

    An Android game inspired by dEXTRIS, an iOS exclusive. Move the cubes left or right or split them with your thumbs to dodge fast incoming obstacles. dexCube is a fast pace, twitch based game perfect for short bursts of fun. Easy to play, but hard to master.  
  
    I removed the game from Google Play due to bugs caused by the deprecated glowing effect library.
