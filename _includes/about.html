    <p>
      Hey, I’m Dennis. I like building and improving systems, especially workflow automation and tools that make day-to-day work faster and more reliable. I’m into anime, cars, and games, and I’m usually tinkering with side projects that mix structure with creativity, like deterministic systems, puzzle and game prototypes, and small tools that shave real time off people’s day. I also like to modify things to make them better, whether that’s software, a workflow, or something mechanical.
