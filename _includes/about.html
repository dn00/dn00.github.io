      <p>
        Hi—I'm Dennis. I'm a software engineer focused on building internal tools and workflow automation for media supply chain operations. 
        I like turning messy, manual processes into reliable systems with clear guardrails: orchestration (Temporal + Python), API-driven services, 
        and production infrastructure on AWS (CI/CD, observability, secure auth). Lately, I’ve also been exploring practical AI/LLM workflows—especially 
        patterns where models propose structured plans and deterministic runtimes validate and execute them for reproducible results.
        <br><br>
        Outside of work, I’m into anime/movies, cars, and games (MMORPGs). I enjoy tinkering with systems—whether that’s software, a build setup, or something mechanical—and making it better.
        <br><br>
